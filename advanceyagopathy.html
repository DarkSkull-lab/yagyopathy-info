  <p><b>Yagyopathy</b>, also called <b>Yagya Therapy</b>, is an ancient Indian healing system that uses sacred fire and medicinal herbs to promote physical, mental, and spiritual healing. The fragrant fumes and powerful mantras are believed to create a purified and energized environment.</p>

  <h2>Ancient Roots</h2>
  <p>Yagyopathy is rooted in <b>Vedic and Ayurvedic traditions</b>. Fire, or <b>Agni</b>, is seen as a divine messenger that carries herbal offerings to the cosmos. These rituals have been used for centuries for both spiritual growth and physical wellness.</p>

  <h2>Holistic Approach</h2>
  <p>This method heals not just the body, but also the <b>mind and soul</b>. It combines fire, breath (pranayama), mantra, and positive intention. Together, they cleanse the atmosphere and the human aura, making it a full-spectrum therapy.</p>

  <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
  <p>Herbs are offered into the <b>Kunda</b>, and the resulting vapor enters through breath. These fine particles impact the <b>nervous system</b> while the mantra vibrations support mental calmness, leading to deep healing.</p>

  <h2>Benefits</h2>
  <p>Yagyopathy is used to manage <b>stress, anxiety, depression</b>, and even chronic illnesses. Participants often feel spiritually uplifted, emotionally relaxed, and mentally focused.</p>

  <h2>Shantikunj's Role</h2>

  <h3>Establishment and Mission</h3>
  <p><b>Shantikunj</b> in Haridwar, founded by <b>Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya</b>, is the main center for spreading Yagyopathy. His mission was to merge <b>spiritual knowledge with modern science</b> for the betterment of humanity.</p>

  <h3>Spiritual Healing</h3>
  <p>More than a medical system, Yagyopathy promotes a balanced life — through <b>meditation, yoga, right conduct</b>, and <b>connection to the divine</b>. It helps people experience peace and clarity in a noisy world.</p>
